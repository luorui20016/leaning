BMC050 accelerometer + magnetometer

So far working with accelerometer only.
Main target - configure motion detection with lowest possible power consumption.

4.2uA: accelerometer in low power mode with 1s sleep interval duration and slope detection interrupt activated; magnetometer in suspend mode.
